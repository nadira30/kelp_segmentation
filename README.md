Introduction/Problem Definition: Provide a brief introduction to your project topic, and
describe why it's an interesting topic to investigate. This is where you want to describe
the problem itself and the motivation behind tackling it.
○ Note: Please include 1-3 paragraphs for this section. Diagrams, visuals, and/or
showing example data can be highly effective to aid in telling your story.

A kelp forest is an ocean community made up of dense groupings of kelps. These forests typically serve as a source of food, shelter, and protection to a wide variety of marine life [1]. Additionally, kelp forests are extremely beneficial to humans as they are estimated to absorb a large amount of carbin dioxide, serve as a shelter for commercially important fishes, prevent coastal erosion and much more [2]. However, these forests face many threats such as climate change, overfishing, and unsustainable harvesting practices [1]. Thus, to preserve and protect kelp forests we propose the development of a model that can map and monitor them in coastal satellite images.

Existing methods, like citizen science classification, are labor-intensive and slow, requiring a more efficient approach 
for comprehensive global monitoring. 

Methods/Approach: Indicate algorithms, methodologies, or approaches you used to
craft your solution. What was the reasoning or intuition for trying each
methodology/algorithm. What does the overall pipeline look like and the details behind
each component? Make sure to establish any terminology or notation you will continue to
use in this section.
○ Note: Your methods and approaches may change through development, so in your
project update, feel free to discuss all approaches you tried out! We expect at
least 1 method/approach attempted.

Experiments / Results: Describe what you tried and what datasets were used. We aren’t
expecting you to beat state of the art, but we are interested in you describing what worked
or didn’t work and to give reasoning as to why you believe so. Compare your approach
against baselines (either previously established or you established) in this section.
Provide at least one qualitative result (i.e. a visual output of your system on an example
image).
○ Note: For the project update, feel free to discuss what worked and didn’t work.
Why do you think an approach was (un)successful? We expect you to have dealt
with dataset setup and completed at least 1 experimental result by the project
update.

What’s next: What is your plan until the final project due date? What methods and
experiments do you plan on running?
○ Note: Include a task list (can use a table) indicating each step you are planning
and anticipated completion date.

Team member contributions: Indicate what you anticipate each team member will
contribute by the final project submission.
○ Note: List every member name and their corresponding tasks in bullet points – or
you may simply assign team member names to the task list you created above.
