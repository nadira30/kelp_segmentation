# Kelp Segmentation: Mapping and Monitoring of Kelp Forests
Computer Vision Class project: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/255/kelp-forest-segmentation/data/

### Introduction/Problem Definition: Provide a brief introduction to your project topic, and describe why it's an interesting topic to investigate. This is where you want to describe the problem itself and the motivation behind tackling it. Note: Please include 1-3 paragraphs for this section. Diagrams, visuals, and/or showing example data can be highly effective to aid in telling your story.

A kelp forest is an ocean community made up of dense groupings of kelps. These forests typically serve as a source of food, shelter, and protection to a wide variety of marine life [1]. Additionally, kelp forests are extremely beneficial to humans as they are estimated to absorb a large amount of carbin dioxide, serve as a shelter for commercially important fishes, prevent coastal erosion and much more [2]. However, these forests face many threats such as climate change, overfishing, and unsustainable harvesting practices [1]. Thus, to preserve and protect kelp forests we propose the development of a model that can map and monitor them in coastal satellite images.

### Related Works: Describe related works in your problem space (research papers,libraries/tools, etc) for existing solutions for this problem or adjacent areas. Make sure to cite papers you reference! Note: Related work should have between 2 to 6 sentences for each work citing. Please cite works following IEEE guidelines. Organize related work into different subsections based on similarity of approaches.

Bla bla bla
Existing methods, like citizen science classification, are labor-intensive and slow, requiring a more efficient approach 
for comprehensive global monitoring. 

### Methods/Approach: Indicate algorithms, methodologies, or approaches you used to craft your solution. What was the reasoning or intuition for trying each methodology/algorithm. What does the overall pipeline look like and the details behindeach component? Make sure to establish any terminology or notation you will continue touse in this section. Note: Your methods and approaches may change through development, so in your project update, feel free to discuss all approaches you tried out! We expect at least 1 method/approach attempted.

### Experiments / Results: Describe what you tried and what datasets were used. We aren’t expecting you to beat state of the art, but we are interested in you describing what worked or didn’t work and to give reasoning as to why you believe so. Compare your approach against baselines (either previously established or you established) in this section. Provide at least one qualitative result (i.e. a visual output of your system on an example image). Note: For the project update, feel free to discuss what worked and didn’t work. Why do you think an approach was (un)successful? We expect you to have dealt with dataset setup and completed at least 1 experimental result by the project update.

### What’s next: What is your plan until the final project due date? What methods and experiments do you plan on running? Note: Include a task list (can use a table) indicating each step you are planning and anticipated completion date.

### Team member contributions: Indicate what you anticipate each team member will contribute by the final project submission. Note: List every member name and their corresponding tasks in bullet points – or you may simply assign team member names to the task list you created above.
